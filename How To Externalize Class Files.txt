# Pre-Note

> This is detailed by inductive support. [here](https://support.inductiveautomation.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047136012-Importing-and-using-3rd-party-Python-libraries-in-Ignition) 

# Steps
> Given the following code stored in a file called "sample.py": 
```
class SampleClass:
	val = 0	
	def callSample(self):
		return "sample"	
	#Used for Class Initiation
	def __init__(self):
		self.val = 0

```
>> Save file here: "C:\Program Files\Inductive Automation\Ignition\user-lib\pylib"

> How to call the file: 
>> Access your script under your designated object
>> Copy and paste the following script:
```
import sample # This is your filename. 
ret = sample.SampleClass() # The host class
text = ret.callSample() # The sub function
system.gui.messageBox(text) #Returning "sample" 
```

# Notes

> Everything in the user-lib folder will be distributed to each user underneath the Ignition cache folder, usually zipped. 
>> Samples of that will be here: C:\Users\USERNAME\.ignition\cache\resources\pylib
